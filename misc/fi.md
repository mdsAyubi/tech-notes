> “Cash is King”

Cash flow is defined as the movement of money into and out of a business. It is usually measured over a specific period of time. Everybody fits into three broad categories: Live for today, Look rich and the New Rich.

Each new loan you take reduces your cash flow making it harder to save. Increasing risk, in an emergency or if interest rates (and EMIs) go up. To avoid the debt trap, buy assets that can increase in value, like a house or a mutual fund. Pay cash for things that decrease in value, like gadgets and maintain an emergency fund.

How to monitor cash flow and how your actions affect your cash flow. Three types of cash flow managers namely live for today, look rich and the new rich. Personal finance is also like a business , it needs two things - an income statement and a balance sheet. Your income statement has two components - income and expenses.

You may have heard income statement referred to as a profit and loss. Your balance sheet is made up of assets and liabilities. Think of these as what you own and what you owe. You may also have heard the balance sheet referred to as a net worth statement.

Your balance sheet is your scorecard for how you managed your cash flows in the past Income minus expenses equals savings.

Financial independence is all about positive cash flow. When income from investments is greater than living expenses, you’re free to do whatever you want.

## Module 4 - Assets

* Choosing The Right Investment – How to decide where to put your savings.
* Types of Assets – Your asset options
* Your Asset Universe – How to balance the different options in your overall portfolio

### The Right Investment

There are five factors that will help you choose:

* Your Investment horizon - how much time you have
* Your ability to accept risk.
> “Know what you own, and know why you own it."

#### Various Asset Classes

* Debt - Debt is a government or corporate obligation.
* Equity - Equity is part ownership of a company, like a share of stock.
* Commodities - Commodities are valuables you can easily buy and sell, like gold.
* Real Estate
* Collectibles - Collectibles are like commodities, but harder to sell and value, like art And alternative investments are more exotic, like venture capital and hedge funds.

#### Taxes

Tax on investments can be on income or on capital gains. Some investments generate income directly. Capital gains are profit from the sale of an asset.

Capital gains are taxed based on how long you held an asset, either short term, or long term. Short term capital gains are applied on profits from equity, debt, gold ETF, mutual funds, and bonds sold after less than one year. And three years for real estate, physical gold and collectibles. Short term capital gains for equity are taxed at 15%. For all other investments, the short-term gains are added to your regular income and taxed at your marginal tax rate.

There are *no taxes* on long-term capital gains from equity. Also, long-term capital gains taxes on other assets are lower than the short-term capital gains tax. There is one more long-term tax benefit you need to know about. It’s called *Indexation*. Indexation adjusts the value of certain investments, so that you don’t have to pay taxes on a portion of the capital gains. Indexation factors for the natural increase in prices due to inflation and wage increases.

### Asset Classes

An asset is simply anything of value that you own. You can sell an asset if you need money. Some examples,

* Debt investments - for example, bonds or fixed deposits Can be short term Or long term Debt generates income, for example, bond coupons or interest payments Debt instrument are usually highly regulated But give you low returns.
* Equities - Equity investing should typically be long term, as short term trading exposes you to volatility risk and taxes on gains. Equities are considered to have more risk and on average generate higher returns.
* Commodities - for example, gold Commodities are traded short term, but are generally considered long term investments, as commissions and fees from buying and selling too often will eat up your returns. Financial investors can invest in gold through gold exchange traded funds and gold mutual funds.
* Real Estate - Real estate is a popular investment product Your investments in real estate have to be for the long term. Because real estate is difficult to sell whenever you want – its liquidity is low. Real estate tends to be a high proportion of many investors’ portfolios. You can alternatively invest in a real estate investment trust, an R-E-I-T, or real estate mutual funds,
* Collectibles: - Most people probably have some collectibles at home, whether art, coins, stamps, or even an old car. Collectibles can be hard to accurately value. Due to the difficulty in trading these items, the risk is high.

## Modules 5 - Dos And Don'ts

* Purchase Smart – Not what to buy, but how to buy.
* Do’s and Don’ts – depending on how you earn.
* The Review Habit – because a wise holding today may not be a wise holding in the future

### Purchase Smart

Ways of investing

* Lump sum purchase
* Rupee cost averaging - This just means investing portions of money over time.
* Systematic Investment Plan, or SIP - A SIP is a commitment to invest fixed amounts in a mutual fund on an agreed schedule.

You should use a lump sum purchase for most of these investments, because the prices and rates of return don’t change much from month to month For equity, you can also benefit from tax savings using an Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) ELSS are tax advantaged mutual funds available via SIP.

### Do's and Don'ts

* Windfall income. A windfall is a rare event, when you unexpectedly get a large lump sum of money.
* Sporadic income – such as a bonus or a sales commission

### The Review

Reviewing your portfolio is an important habit for financial health. Think of this as detoxifying your portfolio, cleaning it up so that it matches your goals.

Ask the following - When did you last look at your portfolio? Why did you buy the assets you have? What are your goals, now? Are you earning the returns you expected? What does your optimal portfolio look like?

Are you holding the right investments? And are they performing in the way you expected them to? Is it time to exit? What are some situations where you should consider a new set of investments?

There are two methods to re-balance a portfolio. The *calendar re-balancing*  method And the *threshold balancing* method.

* Calendar re-balancing - Reallocate the assets on a regular interval.
* Threshold re-balancing is when you choose only to act where there is a significant shift in your asset allocation.

The third reason to realign your portfolio is when the justification for holding an asset is no longer valid.

In summary,

1. You don’t have a good reason for holding the asset.
2. Relative changes in value have unbalanced your portfolio.
3. The justification for holding an asset is no longer valid, because goals have been achieved or postponed.
4. When your wealth savings capability or free cash flow changes significantly.

## Module 6 - Scams

* Scam Danger Signs – red flags for avoiding scams.
* Honest Trading, Sharp Marketing, and Fraud – how to tell the difference.
* Getting Redress – if things go wrong

### Danger Signs

* Super High Returns
* Guaranteed Returns
* Unregistered, unregulated
* Secret or Unclear Business Plan
* Lack of Disclosure, Lack of References
* High Pressure Sales Tactics

### Honest Trading, Sharp Marketing, Fraud

Honest trading is when you get exactly what you want, at a clear and fair price. This is like choosing your own onions. It takes some time, but you pay for only the exact weight you want. If the scale is accurate, this is honest trading.

Have you noticed there always seems to be a bad onion in the bottom of each plastic bag? This is not illegal – you chose the bag and you know what you are getting. It’s just sharp marketing – by adding some fancy packaging, the shopkeeper convinces you to buy something you probably would not have bought otherwise.

What if you got home and you found that one of the onions in your bag was actually a stone? This is fraud – charging you for one thing but giving you something else. And “something else” is usually worthless.

### Getting Redress

* Sell if it makes senses to do so
* Get in touch with the concerned company
* The [SEBI](http://scores.gov.in)
* The Courts

The major regulatory bodies in the country that monitor financial investments are: Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA), Forward Markets Commission (FMC), Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), National Housing Bank (NHB).

If you have complaints on mutual funds, listed stocks, exchanges, portfolio managers, stock brokers you should approach SEBI. If you have complaints on your bank deposits, credit cards or other banking services you should approach the RBI grievance cell. In case of complaints with your housing loans you should approach the National Housing Bank, which is under the Reserve bank of India. For complaints on life insurance and other insurance companies you should approach the grievance cell of Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA). For commodities, you should approach the Forward Markets Commission (FMC). And finally for complaints on pension investments like your Employee provident fund and public provident fund approach the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). But remember, your best bet is to try and get the company to solve the problem directly, without having to go the trouble of contacting the regulator or a court case.

## Risk Cover

* Insurance and Risk – what are your insurance requirements?
* Life Insurance Products – what types of life insurance are available.
* Optimizing Risk Cover – how to ensure you have the right insurance coverage

### Insurance and Risk

What is insurance? First and foremost, insurance is a way of reducing risk. The peak need for insurance is typically between 30 and 40 years old when you have children and mortgage payments. As you get older, your insurance need tapers off as you become more financially secure.

### Life Insurance Products

* The different types of life insurance plans.
* How to calculate how much cover you need.

Insurance is broadly classified into two categories: Life and non-life insurance. Non-life consists of property insurance, health insurance and other insurance such as business insurance or auto insurance.

Life insurance policies can be broadly divided into 5 categories - Term insurance policies, Whole life plans, Endowment Plans, Money back plans, and Unit Linked Insurance Policies, or ULIP.

* Term Life policies are typically the cheapest form of life insurance. Usually, they have the lowest premiums, because you, or rather, your family, benefits only if the risk actually occurs to you.
* Whole-life plans are like term life, but with a maturation date.
* Endowment plans are usually more expensive than insurance alone. Yet because most of the premium goes towards insurance, only a small portion is invested, so overall returns tend to be low.
* Money-back plans are variants of endowment plans. Like endowment plans, a portion of the premium is invested and nominees receive the full sum assured if you die. The big difference is that part of the sum assured is paid out to the policy holder at intervals throughout the policy tenure but the bonus is calculated on the full sum assured and not the balance money left.
* Unit-linked insurance plans. These are like endowment plans, except that you have greater control of your investments. It’s like you’ve purchased insurance plus an investment fund run by the insurance company. You can typically choose what type of fund the investment portion of your premium is put into, whether debt, equity, or something else.

### Optimizing Risk Cover

In general, insurance policy premiums are a function on: The features of the type of policy you choose, for example, insurance only or money back benefit. Your age, with life insurance premiums increasing as you get older. The amount of risk cover – you have to pay more for a bigger policy. Your health and occupation, and, for health or car insurance, your claim history.
